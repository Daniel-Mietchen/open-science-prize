Peter Kraker  @pkraker  Austria BLAZE: An open, collaborative discovery tool  We propose BLAZE, an open discovery tool that goes far beyond the functionality of search engines and social reading lists. The tool builds on Pubmed Central and other open content sources and will provide topical maps for a given list of papers, e.g. a search result or a journal volume. The maps are created automatically using fulltexts to calculate similarities and derive topical structures among papers. Furthermore, they will be enriched with features that are extracted from the papers (e.g. all papers with the same species are highlighted). BLAZE will enable users to do their discovery in a single interface. Users can interact with the maps, explore different topical areas, filter and read individual papers in the same interface. An edit mode will provided for users to make changes to the maps and to introduce new papers and topical areas. Users can openly share maps with others and export the structure in various open formats.  http://openknowledgemaps.org D3.js, rOpenSci, tm English, German JavaScript, R, PHP  PubmedCentral and other open content providers  Collaborators [openknowledgemaps@gmx.at](mailto:openknowledgemaps.org)  Please see https://github.com/pkraker/open-discovery/issues/1
