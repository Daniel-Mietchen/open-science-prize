# About

This file contains a list of Open Science Prize submissions that were drafted or posted in public. The list is likely incomplete &mdash; corrections and additions are welcome.

Note that posting or drafting the full proposal in public was not a requirement of the prize, and that executive summaries of all 96 eligible submissions have been made [publicly available](https://www.openscienceprize.org/p/) after the submission deadline (see also the overview in [this blog post](https://datascience.nih.gov/OSP96Teams)).
