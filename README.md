# About
This repository is intended to help interested parties find collaborators for the [Open Science Prize](https://www.openscienceprize.org/), which aims to stimulate the development of new products or services to harness the power of "big data" to improve health.

Eligible teams must be a collaboration of a U.S. and an international partner.

You can signal your interest in finding collaborators by adding your relevant information to [this TSV file](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/open-science-prize/blob/master/collaboration.tsv). In case of problems, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/open-science-prize/issues/new) or ping me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI).

All of this is optional &mdash; to submit an entry for the prize, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to participate here.

Submissions of entries for the prize have to be made through the Open Science Prize platform by February 29, 2016. To do that, you will need to register an account [there](https://www.openscienceprize.org/acc/r/).
