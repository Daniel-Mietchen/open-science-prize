# About
This repository is intended to help interested parties find collaborators for the [Open Science Prize](https://www.openscienceprize.org/), an initiative by the [Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/), the [US National Institutes of Health (NIH)](http://nih.gov/) and the [Howard Hughes Medical Institute](http://www.hhmi.org/) that aims to stimulate the development of new products or services to harness the power of "big data" to improve health.

Eligible teams must be a collaboration of a U.S. and a non-U.S. partner.

You can signal your interest in finding collaborators by adding your relevant information to [this  file](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/open-science-prize/blob/master/collaboration.tsv) and issuing a new pull request for that. It is in [TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) format, which [renders](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data/) nicely here on GitHub. In case of problems, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/open-science-prize/issues/new) or ping me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI). You are also encouraged to tweet your intention to collaborate, preferably using the [#openscienceprize](https://twitter.com/hashtag/openscienceprize?f=tweets) hashtag.

All of this is optional &mdash; to submit an entry for the prize, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to participate here.

The Prize has two phases &mdash; six prizes of USD 80k each will be awarded in Phase 1, and from these six projects, one will be selected to receive USD 230k in Phase 2.

Entries for the prize have to be submitted through the Open Science Prize platform. To do that, you will need to register an account [there](https://www.openscienceprize.org/acc/r/). Phase 1 submissions are due by February 29, 2016 (11:59:00 PM GMT to be precise, for those wondering about time zones).
