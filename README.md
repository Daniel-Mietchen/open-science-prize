# About
This repository is intended to help find collaborators for the [Open Science Prize](https://www.openscienceprize.org/).
You can signal your interest in finding collaborators by adding the relevant information to [this table](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/open-science-prize/blob/master/collaboration.tsv). All of this is optional &mdash; to submit an entry for the prize, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to participate here.
