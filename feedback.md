# Scope

# Eligibility criteria

# Website
- Make a "News" section! I might be mistaken, but it seems that parts of the website were updated between the announcement and the submission deadline. [@ngehlenborg](https://github.com/ngehlenborg)

# Webinar

# FAQ

# Submission process
- It would be helpful if the submission system would simply accept the latest uploaded files as "the submission" rather than having to explictly submit and then not being able to make any further changes. [@ngehlenborg](https://github.com/ngehlenborg)
